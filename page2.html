   <blockquote>
   <p> Bitcoin is what is known as a virtual currency.1 A virtual currency is a means of payment;
that is, units of the virtual currency represent a value. It is intended for use in payments
within a specifc virtual community, such as a particular website, or in a network of users
with special software for managing the virtual currency and making payments. This type
of virtual community can thus be said to resemble a voluntary agreement to use a specifc
item as a means of payment. This is an important difference to national currencies, such as
the Swedish krona. For the latter, it has been established in law that the monetary unit in
Sweden shall be called the Swedish krona. The virtual currency thus has a different unit of
account than national currencies. For Bitcoin, the unit of account is the Bitcoin itself.
The issuer of the virtual currency can be a non-fnancial company or even a private
individual, but such an issuer is not under the supervision of a government authority. The
issuance of virtual currency is thus not a government-regulated activity.2 However, each
virtual currency has some type of rules of its own governing where and how it may be
used, and some form of technical infrastructure in which the payments are carried out.
The virtual currency, the own set of rules and the technical infrastructure combined form a
small payment system, hereinafter referred to as a virtual currency scheme.
There are a large number of virtual currency schemes that have been built up, and
function, in different ways. They can be broken down into different categories depending
on the extent to which it is possible to buy and sell the virtual currency. Here, we
divide them into virtual currency schemes that are closed, with unidirectional ﬂow and
bidirectional ﬂows. In closed virtual currency schemes, the virtual currency can be neither
bought nor sold, but only earned and used on certain websites (such as World-of-Warcraft
Gold). If the virtual currency can be bought for national currency but not exchanged back,
the scheme has a unidirectional ﬂow (such as Amazon coins). When the virtual currency
can both be bought and sold and used outside of a certain website, the scheme has
bidirectional ﬂows. As explained below, Bitcoin is an example of a scheme with bidirectional
ﬂows. However, these categories can overlap. </p>
