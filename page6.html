    <b><br>What are the disadvantages of Bitcoin?</b>
    <p> Bitcoin got off on the wrong foot by claiming an apocryphal person (or persons), Satoshi Nakamoto as its founder. Nakamoto has never been found.<br>
        
        Regarding more practical concerns, hacking and scams are the norms. They happen at least once a week and are getting more sophisticated. Bitcoin’s software complexity and the volatility of its currency dissuade many people from using it, while its transactions are frustratingly slow. You’ll have to wait at least ten minutes for your network to approve the transaction. Recently, some Reddit users reported waiting more than one hour for their transactions to be confirmed.<br>
        <br><i>Scams to watch out for</i></br>
        
        <br>The four most typical Bitcoin scams are Ponzi schemes, mining scams, scam wallets and fraudulent exchanges.</br>

        <ul>
        <li><b>Ponzi Scams:</b> Ponzi scams, or high-yield investment programs, hook you with higher interest than the prevailing market rate (e.g. 1-2% interest per day) while redirecting your money to the thief’s wallet. They also tend to duck and emerge under different names in order to protect themselves. Keep away from companies that give you Bitcoin addresses for incoming payments rather than the common payment processors such as BitPay or Coinbase.</li>
        <li><b>Bitcoin Mining Scams:</b> These companies will offer to mine outrageous amounts of bitcoin for you. You’ll have to pay them. That’s the last you’ll see of your money (with no bitcoins to show for it, either).</li>
        <li><b>Bitcoin Exchange Scams:</b> Bitcoin Exchange Scams offer features that the typical bitcoin wallets don’t offer, such as PayPal/Credit Card processing, or better exchange rates. Needless to say, these scams leave you in the hang while they siphon your dollars.</li>
        <li><b>Bitcoin Wallet Scams:</b> Bitcoin scam wallets are similar to online wallets – with a difference. They’ll ask you for your money. If robbers like the amount, that’s the last you’ll see of your deposit. The address, in other words, leads to them, rather than to you. Of all of these, wallet scams are the most popular with scammers managing to pinch millions.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>What are the advantages of Bitcoin?</b> <br> <br>
        The best thing about Bitcoin is that it is decentralized, which means that you can settle international deals without messing around with exchange rates and extra charges. Bitcoin is free from government interference and manipulation, so there’s no Federal Reserve System‍ to hike interest rates. It is also transparent, so you know what is happening with your money. You can start accepting bitcoins instantly, without investing money and energy into details, such as setting up a merchant account or buying credit card processing hardware. Bitcoins cannot be forged, nor can your client demand a refund.
        
        It’s small wonder that users call Bitcoin “Money 2.0” or that Bill Gates called it “a techno tour de force.”
