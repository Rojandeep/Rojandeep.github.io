    <blockquote>
   <center> <p><b>Bitcoin</b> is a so-called virtual currency that has been devised for anonymous payments
    made entirely independently of governments and banks. In recent years, Bitcoin has
    generated a great deal of attention on several fronts. Bitcoin payments are based on a new
    interesting technical solution and function differently to traditional payments. In certain
    payment situations, Bitcoin can bring advantages in the form of lower costs, rapidity,
    anonymity, etc. over traditional payment methods.However, usage can also be more risky
    because Bitcoin is not directly covered by the laws that govern other payment mediation.
    Weak consumer protection is also a reason for why it may be diffcult for Bitcoin to
    become generally accepted and viable as a means of payment. Use of Bitcoin for payments
    is low today, and although Bitcoinâ€™s future is uncertain, it is an interesting innovation
    worthy of description.</p></center>
